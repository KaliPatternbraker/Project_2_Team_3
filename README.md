#Step 1. We recived the data from the Alpecha API

#Step 2. Created the buy/sell signal

#Step 3. We coded the calculation the cumulative returns based on the buy/sell signal

#Step 4. We created creating the SMA slow and fast, we are creating extra X variables

#Step 5. We split the data in trading set and the testing set

#Step 6. We are standernizing the X data set using standard scale

#Step 7. The nwxt thing we do is we are training thr SVM model using the traning data

#Step 8. We are predicting using the testing data

#Step 9. We present the model results using classification report

#Step 10. We need to explain the model is doing, we are predicting the buy or sell using APPL 
as a proxy, using SVM model based on the historical data, look how much data we used in (years)
we fined tuned experiencing with different time frames
